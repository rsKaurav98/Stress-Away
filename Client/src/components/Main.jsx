            <h1>Why do we need Therapy?</h1>
            <p>
              Around 1 in 7 students in India face depression. Therapy can be an
              essential tool for students to manage stress, improve academic
              performance, address mental health concerns, navigate transitions,
              and enhance personal growth. If you're a student struggling with
              any of these issues, consider reaching out to a therapist for a
              consultation to discuss your concerns and explore your options.
